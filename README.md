# Quantum Notebook

This repository contains various notebooks used for quantum computing learning. Many are modified from the qiskit repo (https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-community-tutorials/tree/master), but those had to be modified because they rely on depreciated versions of qiskit : (

## How to run

I personally use a virtual environment to run my notebooks. It's as simple as the following:
```
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate # BACKSLASHES ON WINDOWS (ITS DIFFERENT ON POSIX)
(venv) C:/path/to/folder # NOW YOUR ENVIRONMENT IS READY TO RUN
```
Be sure to set up a kernel within your environment and tell Jupyter to use it

Then run the notebooks!

## Learning

Here is a good platform for learning about quantum computing [IBM Quantum Learning](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/)

## About Me

I am Daniel Shea, a student at North Carolina State University. I love to play with quantum computing and am currently learning about algorithm applications. Feel free to reach out to [me](danielgshea.com) @ danielgshea@gmail.com
